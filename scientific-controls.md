# The Crucial Role of Scientific Controls

The Most Important Thing My Mentor Ever Taught Me
I remember it like it was yesterday. I was young, full of ideas, and convinced I was on the verge of a breakthrough. I had just designed what I thought was the perfect experiment—a complex, elegant matrix testing every possible combination of variables I could fit onto a single plate. It was ambitious. It was, in my mind, the fast track to discovery.

I proudly presented the plan to my mentor. She was a brilliant scientist, someone whose opinion I valued more than anyone's. She looked it over, silent for a long moment. Then, she picked up a red pen.

My heart sank as I watched her cross out more than half of my carefully planned experimental groups. In their place, she sketched in more replicates of what I considered the "boring" parts: the positive and negative controls.

"We're losing so many chances to find something new," I protested, my disappointment obvious.

She looked at me and said something that has stuck with me for my entire career. She told me that one of the most important rules in her lab was to always include positive and negative controls, without fail.

She explained that even if it meant I couldn't test all the exciting combinations I wanted to, the controls were non-negotiable. Then she delivered the line that truly changed my perspective:

"I would give priority to the number of controls over the number of experiments," she said. "Especially if you are trying to discover something."

At that moment, I didn't fully understand. It felt like a step backward, a sacrifice of potential discovery for the sake of procedure. But I was wrong. It was the most critical lesson I could have learned.

That day, I learned that real discovery isn't just about seeing a result; it's about being able to believe that result is true. Controls are what give you that confidence. They are your anchor in the unpredictable sea of research. The negative control tells you that your result isn't just a fluke or contamination, and the positive control confirms your entire system is working correctly. Without them, a result is just noise; with them, it can become knowledge.  

My mentor taught me that a handful of variables tested with bulletproof controls is infinitely more valuable than a hundred variables tested with none. It’s not about limiting discovery—it’s about making sure that when you do find something, it’s real. It’s a lesson in rigor, a lesson in intellectual honesty, and it’s the foundation of every successful experiment I’ve run since.
